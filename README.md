# Method
This repository shows how to extract insights from data using statistical and machine learning techniques, as well as data visualization and data operational skills. We'll learn how to work with popular data analysis tools such as Python, SQL, and machine learning frameworks, and work on hands-on projects to apply their knowledge. Overall, the repository provides earners with the skills to make informed decisions based on data, relevant to a wide range of industries. We will learn all the stack required to work in data science, including machine learning operations and cloud infrastructure, as well as real-time industry projects. https://ineuron.ai/

The work contained in this repositories contains Training work conducted during a PhD study undertaken as part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Oil & Gas funded 50% through its National Productivity Investment Fund grant number NE/R01051X/1 and 50% by the University of Aberdeen through its PhD Scholarship Scheme. The support of both organisations is gratefully acknowledged. The work is reliant on Open-Source Python Libraries, particularly numpy, re, glob, BeautifulSoup, requests, matplotlib, plotly and pandas and contributors to these are thanked, along with Jovian and GitHub for open access hosting of the Python scripts for the study.
